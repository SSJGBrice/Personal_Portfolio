				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>I am currently enrolled as a student at Madison Academic Magnet High School in Jackson, Tennessee at the eleventh-grade level. At the conclusion of my senior, I plan to go to college to major in either computer engineering or electrical engineering with a minor in mechanical engineering. I have learned how to code in order to help further my skills with computers so that I may go into a form of free-lance web design or app development should I choose to do so. Through the American Red Cross, I have my certifications in lifeguard, first aid, CPR, and AED. </p>

				<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				<p><strong>Sports :</strong> Swimming and MMA</p>
				<p>I am a competitive swimmer on the Jackson Gators Club Swim team in Jackson, TN. Before swimming, I trained in Muai Thai and Jiu-Jitsu. I greatly enjoy working out and keeping my body healthy. </p>
				<p><strong>Other Hobbies :</strong> Automobiles and PC Gaming</p>
				<p>Recently I acquired a 1974 CJ-5 Jeep with a 304 V8 standard transmission. This Jeep has become the car I have begun learning how to work on cars with. I have learned to change spark plugs, do oil changes, set the timing of the engine, change brakes (both drum and disc), bleed brakes, find wiring problems and fix them, and change a distributor on an engine. Now on the other side of things is PC gaming. I have built my own PC and I play CS:GO, Rocket League, and Overwatch mostly in competitive game modes. </p>
